# MGNREGA Dashboard - Production Architecture for Rural India

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the architectural decisions for a production-ready MGNREGA dashboard serving millions of rural Indians with unreliable internet, low digital literacy, and dependence on government services.

## 1. Design Philosophy for Rural India

### Low-Literacy & Accessibility First
**Challenge**: Users may have limited education and no experience with digital interfaces.

**Solutions**:
- **Icons + Text (Never Text Alone)**: Every metric has an emoji/icon + simple word
  - ❌ "Percentage payments generated within 15 days: 87.5%"
  - ✅ "💰 Fast Payments: 87.5% of workers paid quickly"
  
- **Local Language Support**: Interface translated into regional languages
  - Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam (starting with most populous)
  - Use system fonts, not custom fonts (faster loading in low-bandwidth)
  
- **Simple Color Coding**: 
  - 🟢 Green = Good (payment speed >80%, work days >30)
  - 🟡 Yellow = Average (moderate performance)
  - 🔴 Red = Needs attention (payment delays, low employment)
  
- **No Technical Jargon**: 
  - "Money Spent" not "Total Expenditure"
  - "People Employed" not "Total Individuals Worked"
  - "Families Benefited" not "Total Households"

### Trust & Credibility
**Challenge**: Many users distrust government portals; some rely on intermediaries.

**Solutions**:
- **"Last Updated" Timestamp**: Show when data was last refreshed
- **Data Source Attribution**: "Data from Ministry of Rural Development"
- **Comparison Districts**: Show your district vs. known district (Madurai), making performance tangible
- **Print-Friendly Reports**: Let users save/print data to show others locally

## 2. Technical Architecture for Reliability

### 2.1 Data Layer - Multi-Tier Resilience

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  data.gov.in API        │ (Primary, may throttle/fail)
└────────────┬────────────┘
             │ (Fails? Try Cache)
             ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Local File Cache       │ (7-day TTL for offline use)
├─────────────────────────┤
│ - Last week's data      │
│ - JSON format           │
│ - No network needed     │
└────────────┬────────────┘
             │ (Cache + DB? Serve cache)
             ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Supabase PostgreSQL    │ (Long-term archive)
├─────────────────────────┤
│ - All historical data   │
│ - Indexed by district   │
│ - CDC for real-time     │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Design**:
1. **API Fails**: Use yesterday's cached data (good enough for rural insights)
2. **Network Intermittent**: Load from cache, retry in background
3. **Offline**: User gets 7 days of data, still useful
4. **Scalability**: Cache reduces API calls by 90%

### 2.2 Data Pipeline Features

**Exponential Backoff Retry**:
- API rate-limited? Wait 5s, then 10s, then 20s (smart retry, not hammering)
- Log all failures for debugging

**Duplicate Detection**:
- Hash records by (fin_year, month, district)
- Never insert same month's data twice

**Batch Processing**:
- Fetch 500 records at a time (not 1000 - prevents timeouts)
- Process asynchronously, don't block UI

**Comprehensive Logging**:
- Every API call logged with timestamp, status, count
- 30-day rolling logs for debugging
- Alert on repeated failures (email ops team)

---

## 3. Frontend Architecture

### 3.1 Progressive Enhancement Strategy

**Tier 1 - Core Experience** (2G networks, ~100KB):
```
- HTML structure (no JS needed)
- Pre-computed performance scores
- Essential metrics only
- Color-coded status badges
```

**Tier 2 - Enhanced** (3G, ~500KB):
```
- Interactive charts (Chart.js)
- District comparison
- Trend visualization
- Chart data lazy-loaded
```

**Tier 3 - Full Experience** (4G+):
```
- Real-time filtering
- Advanced analytics
- Multi-district comparison
- Detailed reports
```

### 3.2 Asset Optimization

**For Low Bandwidth**:
- Inline critical CSS (no extra requests)
- Minify all assets (gzip enabled)
- PNG icons instead of SVG (better compression for low-color graphics)
- Lazy-load charts (render only when scrolled into view)
- Cache-bust using version hash in filename

**Example Payload**:
- Initial HTML: 45KB
- CSS inline: 20KB  
- JS: 80KB
- Total initial: ~145KB (loads in 10s on 2G)

### 3.3 Offline-First Approach

```javascript
// Service Worker caches district data
// User can see "last synced: 2 hours ago"
// Background sync updates when online
```

Users get:
- ✅ View last week's data offline
- ✅ See cached reports without network
- ✅ Automatic sync when connection restored
- ❌ Real-time alerts (requires online)

---

## 4. API Design for Reliability

### 4.1 Backend Response Strategy

**When Data Unavailable**:
```json
{
  "status": "cached",
  "message": "Latest data unavailable. Showing cached data from 3 days ago.",
  "freshness": "3 days old",
  "data": { ... },
  "next_sync": "2025-10-26T14:30:00Z"
}
```

User sees notice: "📊 Showing data from 3 days ago (network issue)"

**Rate Limiting**:
- Per-IP: 10 requests/minute (prevent script abuse)
- Burst: 50 requests/minute (allow legitimate spikes)
- Cache: 5-minute Redis cache for same queries

### 4.2 Endpoint Design

**Minimal Endpoints** (Don't over-engineer):
```
GET  /api/dashboard-data?district=X&year=Y
  ↳ Returns everything needed (metrics, trends, comparison)
  
GET  /api/filters
  ↳ District/year/month options for dropdowns
  
GET  /health
  ↳ System status, cache age, data freshness
  
POST /api/feedback
  ↳ Let users report issues (low literacy → high feedback)
```

## 5. Database Schema for Performance

### Optimized Supabase Tables

```sql
-- Main data table (indexed for speed)
CREATE TABLE mgnrega_tn_records (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  fin_year TEXT NOT NULL,
  month TEXT NOT NULL,
  district_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  total_individuals_worked NUMERIC,
  total_households_worked NUMERIC,
  total_exp NUMERIC,
  -- ... 30 more fields
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Indexes for common queries
  UNIQUE(fin_year, month, district_name),
  INDEX idx_district_fin_year (district_name, fin_year),
  INDEX idx_updated_at (updated_at)
);

-- Cache metadata (for offline reliability)
CREATE TABLE cache_metadata (
  key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  last_update TIMESTAMP,
  ttl_hours INTEGER,
  record_count INTEGER
);
```

**Query Performance**:
- District + Year: <10ms (indexed)
- All districts: <100ms (with pagination)
- Time-series trend: <50ms (order by month_num, fin_year)

---

## 6. Monitoring & Alerting

### 6.1 Health Checks (Every 15 minutes)

**System Status**:
```python
/health endpoint returns:
- API response time (target: <5s)
- Cache freshness (age in hours)
- Database connection status
- Error rate (last 24h)
- Data staleness (latest record date)
```

**Alerts Triggered When**:
- ❌ API down for >2 hours
- ❌ Cache older than 10 days
- ❌ Database >5s latency
- ❌ Error rate >5%
- ❌ No new data for 30 days

### 6.2 Logging Strategy

**Per-Request Logging**:
```
[2025-10-26 14:25:33] GET /api/dashboard-data?district=MADURAI
Status: 200 | Time: 45ms | Source: Database | CacheAge: 2h
```

**Aggregated Daily Report**:
```
Daily Summary:
- Requests: 125,000
- Errors: 120 (0.1%)
- Avg Response: 85ms
- Cache Hit Rate: 94%
- Top Districts: Madurai (15k), Coimbatore (12k), Chennai (11k)
```

## 7. Deployment & Scaling

### 7.1 Multi-Region Strategy

```
Primary: Mumbai (Lowest latency for N. India)
Secondary: Bangalore (Backup + S. India)
Tertiary: CDN (CloudFront/Cloudflare for static assets)

↓ If Mumbai fails → Failover to Bangalore (auto, <30s)
↓ If Bangalore fails → Serve cached data from CDN
```

### 7.2 Load Balancing

**Horizontal Scaling**:
- Start: 2 Flask instances behind load balancer
- Auto-scale: Add instance if CPU >70% or latency >2s
- Target: Handle 10,000 concurrent users

**Database Read Replicas**:
- Primary: Write operations
- Replica 1: Read operations (API queries)
- Replica 2: Backup/Analytics

### 7.3 Cost Optimization

**For Serving 10M Monthly Users**:
- Supabase: ~$100/month (generous free tier, then pay-as-you-go)
- Server: 2x t3.medium on AWS (~$60/month) + auto-scaling
- CDN: CloudFront (~$30/month for 1TB/month traffic)
- **Total: ~$200/month** (very affordable for government)

## 8. Security & Privacy

### 8.1 Data Protection

**HTTPS-Only**: All traffic encrypted
**Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute-force attacks
**Input Validation**: Sanitize district names, years
**CORS**: Allow only government domains

### 8.2 Privacy

**Minimal Data Collection**:
- No user tracking cookies
- No IP logging (except for rate limiting)
- No personal information stored
- Data is public (MGNREGA is government transparency program)

### 8.3 Compliance

**Data Localization** (India Stack requirement):
- All data stored in Mumbai region
- No international data transfer
- Compliant with IT Act 2000

---

## 9. User Experience for Low Literacy

### 9.1 Navigation Strategy

**Simple Workflow**:
1. **Opening Page**: Auto-detect district (geolocation) OR large dropdown with district photos
2. **Performance Card**: One big, colorful score with emoji (no numbers if they don't understand)
3. **Metrics Grid**: 6 cards, each with icon + simplified label + value in lakhs/crores
4. **Comparison**: Side-by-side bars comparing to Madurai (visual, not numeric)
5. **Charts**: Only for literate users, not forced

### 9.2 Localization Beyond Translation

**Tamil Nadu Example**:
- Show data in **Tamil numerals** option (not mandatory, alternate)
- Use **regional festivals** as date references if helpful
- Show comparison with **nearby prominent districts** (not always Madurai)

### 9.3 Accessibility

- **Min font size**: 16px (not 12px)
- **High contrast**: Colors tested for colorblindness
- **Touch-friendly**: Buttons >44x44px (mobile)
- **Mobile-first**: Design for 3-inch screens first

## 10. Disaster Recovery

### Scenario 1: API Down (Most Likely)
```
→ Serve cached data
→ Show "Data from 3 days ago" notice
→ Continue normal operation
→ User doesn't even notice
```

### Scenario 2: Database Corrupted
```
→ Restore from daily backup
→ Lose <24 hours of data
→ Alert users of brief outage
→ Full recovery in <2 hours
```

### Scenario 3: CDN Down
```
→ Origin server serves files directly
→ 10x slower but still works
→ Automatic failover
```

### Scenario 4: Complete Regional Outage
```
→ Failover to secondary region
→ Manual DNS switch (<5 min)
→ 99.9% uptime target (27 min/month acceptable)
```

## 11. Future Enhancements

**Phase 2** (3 months):
- Mobile app (offline-first, 5MB download)
- SMS-based queries ("Text 'MADURAI' to 1234567890")
- WhatsApp Bot for district queries

**Phase 3** (6 months):
- Predictive analytics (which districts need attention?)
- Worker personal tracking (with consent)
- Complaint tracking (integrate with grievance system)

**Phase 4** (12 months):
- Real-time job card status
- Wage payment tracking
- Work quality ratings by community

## Conclusion

This architecture prioritizes:
1. **Resilience** over features (API fails? No problem, use cache)
2. **Simplicity** for low-literacy users (icons > words)
3. **Cost-effectiveness** for government budgets (<$200/month)
4. **Scalability** for millions of users (horizontal scaling)
5. **Reliability** with multi-tier fallbacks (99.5% uptime target)

The result: A system that serves rural India even when government APIs fail, users have 2G connections, or national internet outages occur.
